# BubbleePop
You have to clic on the bubble to play. Each player is allow to swap once (if he wants) before to drop two bubbles. To swap two bubbles, you have to touch one bubble then swipe in the intended direction. The swap between the two bubbles will be made.

To drop two bubbles, you have to select the first one (which will be half-colored in white), then the second one. If the couple is legit, gravity will be made, otherwise you have to restart that part. To cancel, you simply need to tap on the first bubble.

If more than three bubbles are aligned, contiguous bubbles with same color will be deleted.
